						<strong>Environment Sustainability and Food Security</strong> are two of the most pressing issues that we have to address today.
						Since then, the common notion is to rely to the government, institutions and to our farmers in solving the crisis.
						While they are the frontliners and their efforts are substantial, we all have to realize that we ourselves are also
						responsible, and are capable in creating the much needed push to aid the plight. We can be heroes too! In light of this,
						like the ASEAN motto says, <strong>“One Vision, One Identity, One Community”</strong>, we have do our part and move together as One.
						<br><br>
						Moreover, overtime, we have relied on specific skills and knowledge thinking that these are the only way.
						Again, while these create a strong foundation in providing solutions, we have to remember that there are
						more than 8 multiple intelligences <em>(Naturalist, Musical, Logical-mathematical, Existential (life smart), Interpersonal,
						Bodily-kinesthetic, Linguistic, Intra-personal, Spatial)</em>. If we will be able to tap these individual uniqueness and
						appreciate our diversity, we will be able to create more innovative solutions and a variety of approaches.
						<br><br>
						With this, we would like to encourage the ASEAN Youth (15 - 35 years old) to use their special skills in addressing Food Security through
						efforts for Environment Sustainability using the 8 multiple intelligences. This will be called<br>
						<strong>8 Acts of Agricooltability</strong> wherein they will be given a platform to hone whatever blessing they
						have by practicing it in alignment to our goal. They can share it to the world via online platforms like Facebook,
						Twitter, and Instagram. From all the posts with hashtags <strong>#FutureReadyASEAN #Agricooltability</strong>, community 
						managers will select the cycle’s winner. They'll get featured, and receive green currencies.

						In 2014, Dr Robert S. Zeigler said that across Southeast Asia the

						</strong>. 
						On the other hand, the median age of the current population is in the 20s. Still true, this shows the 
						<strong>huge gap between our food producers, and the growing number of people to feed</strong>.

						Moreover, <strong>few are attracted to agriculture</strong> because of the extensive hard work and the uneducated perception tagged to 
						farmers in <strong>third world countries</strong>.  However, ironically in farmers in first world countries are usually educated, experienced 
						and enjoys its profitability.
						<br><br>
						Furthermore, there’s more than <strong>600 Million People in Southeast Asia and it’s expected to reach 721 million by 2030</strong>. 
						Evidently added to the number of farmers and their aging sector, there’s a <strong>gigantic pressure to provide supply</strong>.
